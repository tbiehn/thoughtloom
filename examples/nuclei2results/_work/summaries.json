By default, the server responds with a list of allowed methods for that resource which may include information about any authentication or access controls in place.\\n\\nHowever, in this instance, there are no restrictions on the usage of 'OPTIONS' Method, which means that any client can make an HTTP OPTIONS request to the server and get a list of allowed HTTP methods, even if they are not authorized to use them. In some cases, this may expose sensitive information about the server or its configuration, which can be used by attackers for further reconnaissance attacks.\\n\\n## Exploit Scenario\\nAn attacker could use the OPTIONS method to obtain information about the methods and functionalities that are allowed on the server. They could then use this information to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses that they could exploit to launch further attacks against the system.\\n\\n## Recommendation\\nSecure the service by restricting access to the OPTIONS method to only authorized clients. In some cases, disabling the OPTIONS method altogether may also be appropriate.
