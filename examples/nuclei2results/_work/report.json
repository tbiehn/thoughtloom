While the impact of these missing headers can vary, they can potentially expose the system to attacks that aim to exploit such vulnerabilities.\n\n## Exploit Scenario\n\nAttackers can scan for systems that fail to deploy appropriate security headers and exploit them through several mechanisms. For example, they can perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack, which might cause harm to the users of the application accessing the targeted system. Also, this attack can give attackers the ability to take over the targeted system, execute commands, or steal confidential data without the user's knowledge.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nYou should deploy multiple HTTP security headers to protect the target system from potential attacks. Some recommended security headers are:\n* Content-Security-Policy (CSP)\n* X-frame Options\n* HTTP Strict-Transport-Security\n* X-XSS-Protection\n* X-Content-Type-Options\n\nYou can find more information on how to implement these headers by referring to OWASP guidelines or contacting the security team.
