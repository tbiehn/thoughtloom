Individually, these vulnerabilities may seem inconsequential, but when combined, they can lead to a successful attack against the host.\n\nTo mitigate these threats, straightforward changes can be implemented, including:\n\n1. Remove debugging information and server banners from configuration files to reduce the visibility of the underlying infrastructure.\n2. Implement a corporate-wide policy for system configurations using a golden-image, ensuring consistency and security across all hosts.\n\nBy addressing these security concerns, the overall risk to the organization can be reduced and maintain it at an intermediate level.\n\nOutput messages using markdown formatting."},{"role":"user","content":"\n# Summary\nSeverity: Informational\nName: HTTP Missing Security Headers\nEffect: Missing headers can have varying impact on the security of the website.\nFix: Add missing security headers including `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`,`X-XSS-Protection`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`.\nSeverity: Informational\n\nName: HTTP Missing Security Headers\n\nEffect: The HTTP server at http://10.0.0.55 is lacking important security headers.
