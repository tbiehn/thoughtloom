### Example
During the analysis of Metasploitable2, multiple security flaws were discovered within its systems. Individually, these vulnerabilities may seem inconsequential, but when combined, they can lead to a successful attack against the host.

To mitigate these threats, straightforward changes can be implemented, including:

1. Remove debugging information and server banners from configuration files to reduce the visibility of the underlying infrastructure.
2. Implement a corporate-wide policy for system configurations using a golden-image, ensuring consistency and security across all hosts.

By addressing these security concerns, the overall risk to the organization can be reduced and maintain it at an intermediate level.
