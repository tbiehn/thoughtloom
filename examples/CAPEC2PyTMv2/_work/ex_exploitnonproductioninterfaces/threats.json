    "description": "Exploit Non-Production Interfaces",
    "details": "An adversary exploits a sample, demonstration, test, or debug interface that is unintentionally enabled on a production system, with the goal of gleaning information or leveraging functionality that would otherwise be unavailable.",
    "example": "An attacker may exploit a test API that is insecure by default and should not be resident on production systems. Some applications include APIs that are intended to allow an administrator to test and refine their domain. These APIs should usually be disabled once a system enters a production environment.",
    "mitigations": "Ensure that production systems do not contain non-production interfaces and that these interfaces are only used in development environments. Implement appropriate access controls and authentication schemes. Validate and sanitize all inputs. Harden the system and implement multi-factor authentication if necessary.",
    "prerequisites": "The target must have configured non-production interfaces and failed to secure or remove them when brought into a production environment.",
